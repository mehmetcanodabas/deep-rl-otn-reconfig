Implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Optical Transport Network (OTN) Reconfiguration

This project was developed during my position as a Part-Time Research Assistant at the Chair of Communication Networks, TU Chemnitz.  

The work was carried out as part of my research activities under the supervision of the Communication Networks Professorship.  

Since the source code belongs to the institution, it cannot be shared publicly.  

This repository only contains the architecture summary, methodology, and overall design documentation.

**⚠️[Project overview (Pdf)](docs/project-overview.pdf): The problem formulation, proposed architecture, experimental setup, results are provided in this PDF..**
