# PART 5: REPLAY BUFFER CLASS (FOR EXPERIENCE REPLAY)
# Explanation:
# The 'ReplayBuffer' class is a standard experience replay mechanism:
# - It stores state, action, reward, next_state, and done flag for each step.
# - It supports uniform random sampling of batches for training.
# - It also provides an n-step sampling method for multi-step learning.

# PART 6: DEEP Q-NETWORK
# Explanation:
# We define a Dueling Q-network architecture. The neural network splits into
# two streams after shared layers:
#   1) Value stream    - estimates the value of being in a given state.
#   2) Advantage stream - estimates the advantage of each action.
# We then combine them in the final Q-value output. This improves learning
# stability and efficiency in certain environments.

# PART 7: DQNAGENT CLASS
# Explanation:
# This class combines the ReplayBuffer and DuelingQNetwork into a reinforcement
# learning agent. Key features:
#   - Storing experiences in replay memory.
#   - Sampling batches (possibly n-step) for training the Q-network.
#   - Periodic updating of a target network.
#   - Epsilon-greedy policy for exploration vs exploitation.
#   - The 'choose_migration' method selects which migration(s) to perform.
#   - The 'learn' method performs backpropagation at specified intervals.

# PART 10: MAIN TRAINING LOOP
# Explanation:
# This is where the core RL loop executes across multiple episodes:
#   1) We initialize the environment (state) and resets relevant variables.
#   2) For each step, the agent picks a migration action using 'choose_migration'.
#   3) We update the environment with 'process_migrations'.
#   4) The agent stores the (state, action, reward, next_state, done) tuple.
#   5) The agent calls 'learn' intermittently to update its Q-network.
#   6) We log metrics (epsilon, disruptions) and possibly save the best model.
